[cite_start]Achieved a **15% improvement in F1-score** over GPT-3.5 by fine-tuning a Llama-3-8b model on a proprietary financial news dataset[cite: 32]. [cite_start]Utilized Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA to **reduce computational costs by 70%** while maintaining performance, enabling fine-tuning on consumer-grade hardware[cite: 33, 35].
